/**
 * API for datum export data filter services.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This API defines a service provider API that supports accepting datum export
 * data, such as FTP, S3, etc. The {@link #getId()} value should be a globally
 * unique identifier, such as a reverse domain package name for the
 * implementation class of the service.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * It is expected that by implementing {@link SettingSpecifierProvider} any
 * {@link net.solarnetwork.settings.KeyedSettingSpecifier} returned by
 * {@link SettingSpecifierProvider#getSettingSpecifiers()} defines a
 * configurable runtime property that can be used to pass required configuration
 * to the service in the form of property maps in the various methods defined in
 * this interface.
