/*
 NOTE ON CLOCK VS READING

 "Clock" refers to normalized clock periods, where datum rows are interpolated at exact period
 start and end value. This affects accumulating properties in that difference of accumulation
 between two rows on either side of a period transition is split proportionally to each period.

 "Reading" refers to periods where the datum included range from the latest row on or before the
 period start to the latest row before the period end. No interpolation is applied between the
 resulting rows within that range.

 Unless otherwise noted, these functions assume that "reading" tolerance values are larger than
 "clock" tolerance values. The assumption stems from the idea that the "clock" aggregates are
 designed for charting purposes while "reading" for billing.
