expire.title = Data Expire
expire.intro = This page allows configuring data expiration policies which control when datum \
	that have been posted by SolarNodes in your account become eligible to be deleted. \
	SolarNetwork will delete all datum that have expired within a day or so of its expiration.\
	<br><br>\
	Tap on the <kbd>+</kbd> button to create new policies. Once created, edit or delete policies \
	by clicking on their names.

expire.getstarted.title = Get started!
expire.getstarted.intro = To get started, follow these steps: \
	<ol>\
	<li>create an <b>Expiration Policy</b> that defines which data will expire, and when</li>\
	</ol>\
	<p>An expiration policy defines a minimum age the posted data must be before it can be deleted. The age \
	is calculated from the timestamp posted with each datum (not when it arrives in SolarNetwork!). \
	A policy by default will apply to <b>all</b> nodes and sources in your account. You can, however, \
	specify a set of nodes or sources to restrict the policy to.</p>\
	<p>	As your SolarNodes post datum, SolarNetwork will also generate rolled-up aggregate records \
	automatically at hourly, daily, and monthly levels. By default these records are <b>not</b> \
	deleted. You can, however, configure a policy so these rolled-up records are deleted as well.</p>
