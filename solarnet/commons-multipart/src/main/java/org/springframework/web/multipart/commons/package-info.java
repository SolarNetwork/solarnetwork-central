/**
 * Spring web multipart implementation using Apache Tomcat Multipart.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This package was removed in Spring 6, however
 * {@code net.solarnetwork.central.security.web.SecurityTokenAuthenticationFilter}
 * does not work with the
 * {@code org.springframework.web.multipart.support.StandardServletMultipartResolver}
 * as the request body digest cannot be computed after the servlet container
 * parses the multipart content. The code has been adapted to use Apache
 * Tomcat's internal version of Commons Fileupload.
 * </p>
