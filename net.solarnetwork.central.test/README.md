# SolarNet Unit Test Support

This project provides basic unit test support for the SolarNet bundles. To
get started, copy all the files from the `environment/example` directory
into both the `environment/local` and `environment/test` directories. The
former is used when running tests within Eclipse while the latter is used
when running tests from Ant. You can modify copied files as needed to 
match your own environment, as they are ignored from version control.
