/**
 * API for datum expire data filter services.

 * <p>
 * This API defines a service provider API that supports accepting datum expire
 * data. The {@link #getId()} value should be a globally unique identifier, such
 * as a reverse domain package name for the implementation class of the service.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * It is expected that by implementing {@link SettingSpecifierProvider} any
 * {@link net.solarnetwork.settings.KeyedSettingSpecifier} returned by
 * {@link SettingSpecifierProvider#getSettingSpecifiers()} defines a
 * configurable runtime property that can be used to pass required configuration
 * to the service in the form of property maps in the various methods defined in
 * this interface.
