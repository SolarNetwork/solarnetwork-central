# single hour of data on imperfect times, with leading/trailing data
# designed to use with reset record that resets from 100 to 10 @ 12:00
# expected avg(x) = (1.2+1.3+1.4+1.5+1.6+1.7)/6 == 1.45
# expected avg(y) = (2.1+3.1+4.1+5.1+6.1+7.1)/6 == 4.6
# expected clock diff == (115 - (105-(105-100)*0.9)) + ((25+(30-25)*0.1)-5) == 35
# expected read  diff == (115-100)+(25-5) == 35
